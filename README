== Description

BlackBoard provides a folder-layer to memcache-client. A BlackBoard is created with a static structure of folders and items.

bb = BlackBoard.new :ttl => 2 do
 folder :folder1, [:name1] do
   folder :folder1, [:name1, :name2]
   folder :folder2, [:name2]
   folder :folder3, [:name2]
 end

It is aimed at quickly writing and reading, usually attached to EventMachine, for example.
Objects written to the blackboard must answer to :timestamp, for they will expire.

class TestObject
  attr_reader :timestamp
  def initialize; @timestamp = Time.now; end
end

obj = TestObject.new

To write an item from a folder:

bb.folder1.folder1.name1 = obj

To retrieve an item from a folder

obj = bb.folder1.folder1.name1

To retrive all items in a folder:

items = bb.folder1
obj = items[:folder1][:name1]
